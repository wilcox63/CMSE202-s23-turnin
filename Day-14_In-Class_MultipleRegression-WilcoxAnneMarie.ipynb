    "- `poverty.dat` which is the data file itself\n",

    "Let's face it, sometimes data is bad. Values are not recorded, or are mis-recorded, or are so far outside of your expectations that you suspect that there is something wrong. On the other hand, just **changing** the data seems like cheating. We have to work with what we have, and if we have to make changes it would be good to do that programmatically so that it is recorded for others to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)\"> imputation </a> is the statistical replacement of missing/bad data with substitute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It turns out that we have a case of missing data in our dataset!** In the **Gross National Product (GNP)** column some of the values are set to \" \\* \" indicating missing data. When Pandas reads in the column the only type that makes sense when both characters _and_ numbers are present is a string. Therefore Pandas chose to set the type to `object` instead of the expected `int64` or `float64`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `numpy.nan` as a replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "For better or worse, pandas assumes that \"bad values\" will be marked in the data as **NaN** which it can then represent using [NumPy's \"`nan`\"](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/constants.html#numpy.nan). NaN is short for \"Not a Number\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**If we can mark the missing data with \"NaN\" instead of \"\\*\", we will have access to some of the imputation methods, which would allow us to replacing the NaN values with various substitution values (e.g. mean, median, specific value, etc.)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are (at least) **two ways** to do this:\n",
    "1. You can do a `.replace` on the column using a dictionary of the form \"{value to replace : new value, ...}\". If you do this, **remember to save the result**. After you do this, you'll still need to change the column type from \"object\" to a \"float64\" in order to assure that the values are numeric values. Note that you cannot convert a `np.nan` to an integer but you can to a float.\n",
    "2. You can convert the everything that can be converted to a number using the Pandas `.to_numeric()` function. Conveniently if you use the \"`errors`\" argument in the function you can force Pandas to convert any non-numbers to \"`np.nan`\" values. As with the previous method, you need to save the converted column in place of the column with the \"\\*\" entries. This option has the benefit of not requiring an additional step of having to manually change the data type!\n",
    "\n",
    "**&#9989; Do This:** Convert the missing entries in the GNP column to `np.nan` values and show the head of your modified DataFrame to ensure that the \"NaN\" values are showing up. Also print the `dtypes` to show that the column has changed type."
